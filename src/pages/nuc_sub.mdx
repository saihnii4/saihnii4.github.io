# Nucleophilic Substitution

Nucleophilic substitution reactions consist of three components: the **nucleophile**, **electrophile** and a **leaving group**.

> Recall that the electron-rich nucleophiles attack electron-deficient electrophiles

# Sn2 - Nucleophilic Attack at a Saturated Carbon Atom

'Sn2' stands for "**S**ubstitution **n**ucleophilic **bi**molecular". Let's break it down:

- S (for substitution) indicates that the Sn2 reaction is a substitution reaction (real shocker!)
- n (for nucleophilic) suggests that the added reagent is a nucleophile that will react with the molecule
- 2 (for bimolecular) tells us that the __rate-determining step__ of the reaction is bimolecular

> The rate-determining step will be explained later in this page

## Mechanism of the Sn2 Reaction

The mechanism of the Sn2 reaction involves a nucleophilic species attacking an electrophilic carbon atom to release a leaving group.

In simpler terms, the electron-rich nucleophile approaches the backside of a carbon atom [see diagram below] to create a bond between the carbon atom and the nucleophile while breaking the leaving group bond.

These steps occur simultaneously which chemists refer to as being **concerted**.

Because the Sn2 reaction has a concerted mechanism, it occurs in a **single step**

> Note that unsaturated carbons, carbons with pi bonds, are unlikely recipients of Sn2. This is reasoned through MO theory which is out of the scope of this page

## Transition state of the Sn2 reaction

The transition state of the Sn2 reaction is **linear**. That is, a single dashed line can be drawn connecting the __leaving group__, __attacked carbon atom__ and __nucleophile__.

You may be familiar with a reaction coordinate diagram as it is similar to an energy level diagram.

However reaction coordinate diagrams differ in that they depict the **intermediates** and **transition states** of a reaction.

## Stereochemical Outcome of Sn2

Another direct consequence of the linear Sn2 transition state is the **inversion of configuration** for the stereocenter being attacked via Sn2.

The nucleophile attacking the carbon 'pushes' away the leaving group while forcing the other groups to be nearly __periplanar__ with one another. Thus the new C-Nu bond occurs on the opposite side of the previous C-LG bond, leading to an inversion of configuration

## Nucleophilic Nitrogen and the Inductive Effect

Nitrogen serves a crucial role in organic chemistry. Nitrogen-containing compounds make a majority of pharmaceutical drugs; your DNA is made up of billions of nitrogen atoms alone all in the form of organic compounds containing nitrogen

Amines are one example of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. You can think of amines as ammonia with a carbon chain substituted for an hydrogen atom.

The nitrogen atom in amines carry interesting properties. Much like ammonia, the nitrogen atom's lone pair is basic and nucleophilic. [And in fact amines can be synthesized from ammonia]

A direct consequence of this nucleophilicity is that amines are willing to undergo Sn2 with halogenoalkanes (or alkyl halides) quite readily.

However if you react methylamine with even a moderate amount of methyl bromide, you will find that you can never be able to isolate dimethylamine (the disubstituted product).

### Why is that?

The "overalkylation" of amines is a result of the __positive inductive effect__.

Electronegative atoms such as the halides, nitrogen and oxygen tend to warp electron density towards them. This effect is what results in a dipole between them and their interacting atom.

Take hydrogen chloride for instance, the chlorine warps the hydrogen's electron density towards itself, leading to a partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom and a partial negative charge on the chlorine atom.

A similar effect takes place here as the methyl group 'donates' electron density to the nitrogen atom, further increasing the electron density on the nitrogen atom and hence increasing its nucleophilicity.

When methyl bromide reacts with methyl bromide, the product-dimethylamine-has two methyl groups attached, meaning that there are twice as many electron-donating groups and hence a more nucleophilic character.

The issue here is that dimethylamine is **more nucleophilic** than methylamine, meaning that it will gladly react with methyl bromide before methylamine has a chance to attack.

This overalkylation of amines makes Sn2 with amines restricts its use and thus more preferable methods of creating C-N bonds have been invented [such as reductive amination and diazonium salts] 

# Sn1 - Two step unimolecular nucleophilic substitution 

The product of the Sn1 reaction is identical to if Sn2 had occurred instead. So, empirically, it may be difficult to tell the two apart from a single reaction alone.

So how do you differentiate Sn1 from Sn2?

Well, for starters Sn1 involves a **two-step** mechanism whereas Sn2 undergoes a **one-step** mechanism.

## The Mechanism of Sn1

The first step of Sn1 is the ejection of a leaving group to form a carbocation. This is a __reversible__ reaction as the leaving group (which is typically a nucleophile) can attack the positively charged carbon to reform the product.

In addition, this intitial step has a __large energy barrier__ as it involves the formation of a carbocation that is higher in energy than the reactant.

The second step involves nucleophilic attack by the desired nucleophile at the positve carbon to form the final product.

Note that the first step produces an **intermediate**, the carbocation, that reacts in the second step much faster than the reactant does in the first step.

You can rationalize this through an energy diagram, note the energy barrier for each step.
